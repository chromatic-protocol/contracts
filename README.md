# Chromatic Protocol

Chromatic Protocol is a decentralized perpetual futures protocol that provides permissionless, trustless, and unopinionated building blocks which enable participants in the DeFi ecosystem to create balanced two-sided markets exposed to oracle price feeds and trade futures in those markets using various strategies.

It is the very first protocol that introduces the concept of partitioned LP with dynamic fees. Chromatic Protocol provides a liquidity pool divided into multiple bins with different trading fee rates. The fee rate at which trades are executed is determined based on the dynamics of taker’s trading demand and maker’s liquidity supply. This dynamic fee system achieves a balanced maker-taker equilibrium, mitigating the inherent instability of closed systems like futures markets and significantly enhancing the sustainability of the protocol.

Furthermore, Chromatic Protocol is a permissionless, open-source, non-upgradable protocol that enables the creation and trading of futures markets exposed to price feeds provided by an oracle. It is characterized by a minimalist, low-level, and unopinionated design. Market creators and participants can define customizable markets supported by the protocol to optimize and innovate, fostering a secure and optimized decentralized financial ecosystem.

Lastly, Chromatic Protocol is trustless and censorship-resistant. By eliminating trusted intermediaries and rent extraction commonly found in traditional futures markets, it ensures fair and capital-efficient trading by processing transactions based on smart contracts. Additionally, Chromatic prioritizes accessibility and censorship resistance, enabling anyone to freely participate in the decentralized financial market.

Chromatic Protocol is currently built on Arbitrum.

## Installation

Install Foundry using the instructions
[here](https://book.getfoundry.sh/getting-started/installation.html) or via
these commands:

```
$ curl -L https://foundry.paradigm.xyz | bash
$ foundryup
```

To install the necessary dependencies, run the following command:

```shell
yarn install
```

## Usage

### Compilation

To build the smart contracts, run the following command:

```shell
yarn build
```

### Testing

To run the forge unit tests for the smart contracts, use the following command:

```shell
yarn test
```

To run the tests for the smart contracts, use the following command:

```shell
yarn hardhat test
```

You can also generate a gas report during testing by running the following command:

```shell
REPORT_GAS=true yarn hardhat test
```

### Local Development

To run a local node for development and testing purposes, use the following command:

```shell
yarn chain
```

### Deployment

To deploy the smart contracts to the desired network, update the network configuration in the hardhat.config.js file. Then, run the deployment script:

```shell
yarn deploy
```

Make sure to customize the deployment script (`deploy/*.ts`) with any additional deployment logic or parameters specific to your project.
